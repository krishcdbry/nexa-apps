# Screenshot Instructions for NotesApp Preview

## How to Capture the Perfect Screenshot

1. **Open the App**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5174/
   - Make sure both the API and UI are running

2. **Prepare the UI**
   - Create 3-4 sample notes with different tags
   - One note should be selected and displayed in the editor
   - Use realistic content (not "test" or "lorem ipsum")
   - Make sure stats show some numbers

3. **Sample Notes to Create:**

   **Note 1: "Project Roadmap Q1 2024"**
   - Content: "Complete NexaDB 3.0 launch with new MessagePack protocol. Launch NotesApp as flagship example. Update documentation and client libraries."
   - Tags: work, planning, important

   **Note 2: "Recipe: Thai Green Curry"**
   - Content: "Ingredients: coconut milk, green curry paste, chicken, bamboo shoots, Thai basil. Cook curry paste, add coconut milk, simmer with chicken for 20 minutes."
   - Tags: cooking, personal, recipes

   **Note 3: "Book Ideas for 2024"**
   - Content: "1. The Pragmatic Programmer\n2. Designing Data-Intensive Applications\n3. Clean Architecture\n4. System Design Interview"
   - Tags: reading, learning, tech

   **Note 4: "Meeting Notes - Team Sync"**
   - Content: "Discussed new features for Q1. Priority on vector search optimization. Sprint planning next week."
   - Tags: work, meeting

4. **Capture Settings**
   - Use Chrome/Firefox at full screen or large window
   - Resolution: At least 1920x1080
   - Format: PNG for best quality
   - Include the entire application (all three columns visible)

5. **Capture the Screenshot**
   - On Mac: Cmd + Shift + 4, then Space, click window
   - On Windows: Windows + Shift + S
   - Or use browser screenshot extensions

6. **Save Location**
   - Save as: `/Users/krish/krishx/nexadb/examples/NotesApp/preview.png`
   - Also create a smaller version: `preview-small.png` (800px width for README)

7. **Post-Processing (Optional)**
   - Add subtle shadow around the screenshot
   - Compress to reduce file size (use TinyPNG or similar)
   - Verify it looks good on both light and dark GitHub themes

## After Screenshot

1. Move the file to `/Users/krish/krishx/nexadb/examples/NotesApp/preview.png`
2. Update README.md to reference the image
3. Commit both the screenshot and updated README

## Alternative: Use Open Graph Image

Instead of a screenshot, you could also create a professional Open Graph image:
- Size: 1200x630px
- Include NexaDB branding
- Show key features in visual format
- Use design tools like Figma or Canva
